# LSTM Model Tuning

A deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. This repository includes data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- **LSTM Architecture**: Utilizes a stacked LSTM architecture with dropout layers for regularization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs Keras Tuner for efficient hyperparameter optimization.
- **Early Stopping**: Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.
- **Data Scaling**: Uses Min-Max Scaler for normalizing the input data.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots for actual vs predicted prices, residuals, and their distribution.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the best-performing model for future use.
 The script will:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Tune hyperparameters using Keras Tuner
   - Train the model with early stopping
   - Save the best model
   - Generate prediction plots and residual analysis

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loads the stock data
   - Scales the data using Min-Max Scaler
   - Creates training and testing datasets

2. **Model Building**:
   - Defines an LSTM model architecture with hyperparameter tuning

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Uses Keras Tuner to find optimal model parameters

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trains the model with early stopping
   - Saves the best-performing model

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Makes predictions on the test set
   - Calculates residuals
   - Visualizes actual vs predicted prices
   - Plots residual distribution

## Limitations

- The model is trained on historical data and assumes that future market behavior will follow similar patterns.
- It does not account for external factors like economic indicators, news events, or company announcements.
- The performance may vary depending on the quality and length of the input data.
